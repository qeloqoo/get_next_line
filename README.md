# get_next_line
Small educational project to code function that would read file one line at a time.
Certain constrains were set:
- 1 source file with no more than 5 short functions
- no memory leaks
- use of global variables was forbidden

Reading from multiple files simultaneously provided bonus points during evaluation.

./libft library which is included in get_next_line is one of our previous projects. It required us to re-write set of standard C library functions for future use in C curriculum.
